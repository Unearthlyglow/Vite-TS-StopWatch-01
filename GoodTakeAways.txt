1. Need to go over a couple of starting from scratch Git Exercises.

3. Refactor/Move CSS Grid notes and make sure html {
          font-size: 62.5% 10px/16px = 62.5% = 1rem = 10px
        }

5. Go over JS file and break it down with notes, line by line(as needed)

Remainder (%)modulo: 
The remainder operator (%) returns the remainder left over when one operand is divided by a second operand. It always takes the sign of the dividend.

15 % 2
